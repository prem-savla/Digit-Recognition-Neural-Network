Developed a digit recognition neural network using only NumPy, achieving 84.5% accuracy on the validation set after 500
training iterations.
Implemented forward and backward propagation algorithms, employing matrix operations and activation functions
(ReLU, softmax) for efficient computation.
Preprocessed input data through normalization and one-hot encoding, enabling optimized training and accurate model
